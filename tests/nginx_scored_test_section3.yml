    title: 3.3 Ensure error logging is enabled and set to the info logging level (Scored)
    meta:
      webserver: 1
      proxy: 1
      loadbalancer: 1
      CIS_ID: 3.3
      Remediation: Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf so the error_log directive is present and not commented out. The error_log should be configured to the logging location of your choice and info logging level.
    exit-status: 0
